    <h2>â€¢DESTITUTION</h2>
    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><br>  
    <b><p>Poverty is a situation in which people remain deprived of basic necessities of life such as inadequacy of food, clothes, and shelter. Most of the people in India cannot get their two times meal properly, sleep at roadside and wear dirty and old clothes. They do not get proper and healthy nutrition, medicines, and other necessary things. Poverty in the urban India is increasing because of the increase in urban population as people from rural areas like to migrate to the cities and towns to get employment or do some financial activity. The income of around 8 crore urban people is below poverty line and 4.5 crore urban people is on borderline of poverty level. A huge number of people live in slum become illiterate. In spite of some initiatives there is no any satisfactory results shown regarding reduction of poverty.</p></b><br><br>
    <h4>CAUSES OF POVERTY</h4><br>
    <b><p>The main causes of poverty in India are growing population, poor agriculture, corruption, old customs, huge gap between poor and rich people, unemployment, illiteracy, epidemic diseases, etc. A huge percentage of people in India depend on agriculture which is poor and cause poverty. Generally people face shortage of food because of poor agriculture and unemployment. Ever growing population is also the reason of poverty in India. More population means more food, money and houses. In the lack of basic facilities, poverty grows more rapidly. Becoming extra rich and extra poor creates a huge widening gap between the rich and the poor people. Rich people are growing richer and poor people are growing poorer which creates an economic gap between the two.</p></b><br><br>
    <h4>EFFECTS OF POVERTY</h4><br>
    <b><p>Some of the effects of poverty are like: <br> <br>

        âœ¨Illiteracy: poverty makes people unable to get proper education because of the lack of money. <br>
        âœ¨Nutrition and diet: poverty causes insufficient availability of diet and inadequate nutrition which brings lots of lethal diseases and deficiency diseases. <br>
        âœ¨Child labor: it gives rise to the huge level illiteracy as the future of the country gets involved in the child labor at very low cost in their early age. <br>
        âœ¨Unemployment: unemployment causes poverty as it creates the lack of money which affects peopleâ€™s daily life. It forces people to live unfulfilled life against their will. <br>
        âœ¨Social tensions: it creates social tension due to the income disparity between rich and poor. <br>
        âœ¨Housing problems: it creates the bad condition for people to live without home on the footpath, roadside, other open places, many members in one room, etc. <br>
        âœ¨Diseases: it gives rise to the various epidemic diseases as people with lack of money cannot maintain proper hygiene and sanitation. Also they cannot afford a doctor for the proper treatment of any disease. <br>
        âœ¨Feminization of poverty: poverty affects womenâ€™s life to a great extent because of the gender-inequality and keeps them deprived of the proper-diet, nutrition, medicines and treatment facility.</p></b> <br><br>
    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>  <br>
    <b><p>Poverty is not only the problem of a person however it is a national problem. It must be solved on urgent basis by implementing some effective solutions. Variety of steps has been taken by the government to reduce poverty however no clear results are seen. Eradication of poverty is necessary for the sustainable and inclusive growth of people, economy, society and country. Eradication of poverty can be done effectively by the unite effort of each and every person.</p></b>  <br><br><br>
    <h2>â€¢STARVATION</h2>
    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><br>
    <b><p>Starvation is a very deadly condition which results in malnutrition and even loss of life. India and starvation have been going hand in hand for a very long time. It is so because the people living below the poverty line in India are very high. Moreover, starvation is a cause of so many deaths every year that it needs to be stopped. We must recognize the causes of starvation in India so we can work better to eradicate them. Furthermore, when we eradicate starvation we will also be ending a lot many problems.</p></b><br><br>
    <h4>CAUSES OF HUNGER</h4><br>
    <b><p>There are a number of causes due to which starvation happens in our country. First, we will look at the regions hit most by this condition. The areas of North Bengal, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh suffer the most in this aspect. The most important reason is that of poor implementation of government schemes. <br><br>

        The government of India has released numerous schemes which aim to eradicate this problem; however, there is a very poor implementation of these. Corruption makes it difficult to let these schemes become a success. <br><br>
        
        Moreover, the officials who are appointed with distributing grains or monitoring this procedure have the least interest in the welfare of the people. Thus, it makes it impossible to make an adequate supply of food available to people. <br><br>
        
        Furthermore, the state does not exactly specify which people come under the â€˜poorâ€™ sector. While the National Food Security Bill promises to offer people facilities like mid-day meals and health care schemes for pregnant women, it does not specify who is eligible for this. Therefore, this vague description often contributes to the failure of such well-intended schemes.</p></b><br><br>
    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4><br>
    <b><p>The best conclusion for starvation is money, if money is there then we could make many facilites for food.</p></b>
